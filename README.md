# Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) Design ðŸ“¡

This repository contains the design and documentation of a **Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)** project developed at Hochschule Bremen, Germany.

ðŸ“„ Full project report is available in:
- `Low-Noise-Amplifier-Project-Report.pdf`

##  Project Overview
- **Objective**: Design a low-noise amplifier (LNA) with maximum transducer gain and unconditional stability.
- **Technology**: Rogers RO4003C substrate, thickness 32 mil, with copper cladding.
- **Active Device**: Infineon BFP620F transistor.
- **Simulation Tool**: NI AWR Microwave Office.
- **Target Frequency**: 4.5 GHz
- **Bias Point**: Vce = 2.0 V, Ic = 15 mA
- **Achieved Gain**: 13.337 dB (stable)

##  Methodology
- Extract **S-parameters** of the transistor.
- Calculate reflection coefficients Î“S and Î“L using Smith Chart analysis.
- Design input and output matching networks using:
  - Lumped elements
  - Ideal transmission lines
  - Microstrip lines (final implementation)
- Verify stability (Î¼-test) and optimize for maximum gain.
- Fabricate PCB and validate performance with lab measurements.

##  Key Results
- **Reflection Coefficients**:
  - Î“S = 0.579 âˆ  -175.88Â°
  - Î“L = 0.523 âˆ  80.46Â°
- **Overall Transducer Gain**: 13.77 dB
- **Stability**: Unconditionally stable at 4.5 GHz
- **Final Implementation**: PCB tested in laboratory with results close to simulations.
